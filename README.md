# MSA-SpringBoot-Demo
<br/>
**This project is part of of my lab assignments for Software Intensive Solution lab @ Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts. In that lab, I developed a full-fledged distributed system using **Microservice Architecture and N-Tier Architecture**. Also utilized Domain Driven Design for the system design and modeling.**
<br/>
This project is a boilerplate and will demonstrates the integration of the two services using Eureka and Spring Cloud Config. It will also demonstrate how Circuit breaker pattern work which is used in microservices architecture to prevent cascading failures.

<br/>
<br/>
**In this guide, i will devide the development into 5 chapters. This to make it easy follow up and make the work more organized.**

## CHAPTER 1 - Implementing Microservices using Spring Boot
### Introduction to Spring Boot
Spring Boot is a framework for building Java applications. It simplifies the setup and development of new Spring applications by providing a range of default configurations. <br/>

### Creating Microservice 1
1- Create a Spring Boot Project: <br/>
Use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to generate a new project with the following dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Boot DevTools .  ( Later we will add more dependecies as we progress ).
<br/>

2- Setup Project Structure: <br/>
Unzip the generated project and open it in your favorite IDE (I'm usiing VS Code).
<br/>

3- [Microservice 1 Configuration](https://github.com/CodingF0X/MSA-SpringBoot-demo/blob/feature-microservice1/microservice1/Microservice1.md).


### Creating Microservice 2
Follow the same steps for creating Microservice 1

[Microservice 2 Configuration](https://github.com/CodingF0X/MSA-SpringBoot-demo/blob/feature-microservice2/microservice2/Microservice2.md).
